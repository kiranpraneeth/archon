## Version A: The Insight-Led Hook

**Managing AI agents is remarkably similar to managing engineers.**

I've spent years as an engineering leader, and this week I started building something that crystallized an insight I've been circling for months.

When you onboard a human engineer, you:
→ Provide context about the codebase and team
→ Define their responsibilities
→ Set quality expectations
→ Review their work
→ Help them escalate when uncertain

It turns out, building effective AI agents requires the exact same things.

I'm building Archon — an AI-native developer experience platform — as a deliberate experiment in "agentic engineering management." The first agent is a Code Review Agent, and setting it up felt less like configuring software and more like onboarding a new team member.

The context file defining its behavior? Essentially an onboarding document.
The review checklist? Team coding standards.
The escalation rules? "When to ping your manager."

This isn't a technical revolution. It's a management translation.

I'll be sharing what I learn along the way — the patterns that work, the mistakes I make, and how I think this changes what engineering leadership looks like.

If you're curious about how AI changes the shape of engineering teams (not just the tooling), follow along.

What's your mental model for AI in your team's workflow?

## Follow-Up Post Ideas (for later weeks)

1. "The three layers of context every AI agent needs"
2. "What code review taught me about agent design"
3. "When to use AI agents vs. when to use humans"
